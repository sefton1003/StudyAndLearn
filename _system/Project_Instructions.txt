🧭 Project Description — Study & Learn: Developer–Creator Edition

This project houses the **Study & Learn System** — an adaptive, hands-on curriculum for mastering **C#**, **Unity**, **.NET MAUI**, and **AI-assisted development** using **Codex** and **AgentKit**.  
It combines technical education with creative application, turning your own projects into the classroom.

**Mission:**  
To build fluency across code, design, and narrative — learning by making things that matter to you.

---

### 🎓 Core Workflow
1. **Learn** → short, focused lessons that introduce one new concept at a time.  
2. **Apply** → immediately use it in a small Unity or MAUI prototype.  
3. **Reflect** → log insights and progress in `_system/Study_Log.txt`.  
4. **Version** → commit changes with Git to track growth and back up work.

---

### 🧰 Active Tool Stack
- **VS 2022** – primary IDE for MAUI apps and C# debugging  
- **VS Code** – for Unity scripts, agents, and lightweight edits  
- **Unity Hub (LTS Editor)** – for game projects  
- **Git + GitHub** – version control and backup  
- **OpenAI API / AgentKit** – AI integration and experimentation

### 🪜 Learning Phases

| Phase | Focus | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 0️⃣ Setup Cycle | Configure tools & Git | Verified environment |
| 1️⃣ C# Apprentice | Core syntax & logic | Console projects |
| 2️⃣ Unity Explorer | Scenes & scripting | Playable prototype |
| 3️⃣ Codex Collaborator | AI prompting & refactoring | Agent tools |
| 4️⃣ Systems Designer | Game & app architecture | Integrated systems |
| 5️⃣ Game Builder | Release & iteration | Public build or app store release |

* Update: Lesson Cycle Enhancements *

Beginning with Lesson 3.3, all Study & Learn lessons include two structural upgrades:
  - Git Integration: each session starts with a pull/sync check and ends with commit-push-tag practice.
  - Real-World Context: a closing reflection connects the lesson’s concept to real app, game, or agent development.

This keeps learning, workflow, and version control in one continuous rhythm.
