🗒️ Study & Learn — Study Log (v1.0)

Purpose: quick reflections after each session to lock in memory and guide adaptations. I’ll append entries here when you run `save study log`.

──────────  RUNNING ENTRIES  ──────────

Date: 2025-10-10
Lesson(s) covered: C# Basics – Variables & Types
Pre-Test quick summary: Confident with core terms; small syntax gaps.
Today’s key concept(s): Declaring and using variables; input/output; type conversion with Parse; string interpolation.
What clicked: Relationship between variable types and data.
What was fuzzy: Remembering exact punctuation and modifiers like $.
Where I want more practice: Syntax precision and efficient logic.
What I built / changed: Name-and-score console app with bonus calculation.
Time spent: ~40 minutes
Mood / energy: Focused and optimistic; “good kind of hard.”
Next step suggestion (AI): Proceed to Lesson 2 — Control Flow (if/else, loops).

──────────  ENTRY  ──────────
Date: 2025-10-11
Lesson(s) covered: C# Control Flow 2
Pre-Test quick summary: Knew basics of if/else and loops; unsure about when to use for vs while.
Today’s key concept(s): Conditional branching (if/else, logical operators) and iterative control (for, while, do...while).
What clicked: Loop syntax and modular (CodexBuzz) pattern logic; how to combine multiple conditions.
What was fuzzy: Deciding when to use for vs while; will explore more examples.
Where I want more practice: Nested conditionals and input validation.
What I built / changed: Even/Odd Countdown program and CodexBuzz stretch challenge.
Time spent: ~45 min
Mood / energy: Focused, confident.
Next step suggestion (AI): Begin Lesson 3 – C# Classes & Objects after reviewing the difference between for- and while-loops in small test snippets.

=== 2025-10-12 ===
• Reorganized Study & Learn folder structure
• Created Dev\StudyAndLearn workspace with proper subfolders
• Initialized Git repository and first commit
• Linked VS Code and confirmed working tree clean
• Verified Source Control integration (blue Publish Branch)
Next step: configure VS Code for C# extensions and test Hello World.
---
=== 2025-10-12 ===
• Completed full Setup Cycle
• Verified Git installation and commit workflow
• Linked VS Code successfully (Source Control clean)
• Created and installed v2.0 Instructions and Project Instructions
• Added Life Map and confirmed doc structure under /docs
Status: Setup Cycle Complete — environment verified, ready for Lesson 0.2 (VS Code C# configuration)
Next: Open VS Code, install C# Dev Kit + .NET tools, and run “Hello World”
---
=== 2025-10-13 ===
• Verified .NET 9 SDK and VS Code integration  
• Created Lesson00_HelloWorld project  
• Successfully compiled and ran “Hello, Study & Learn!”  
Status: Environment confirmed working  
Next → Lesson 3 (C# Classes & Objects)

=== 2025-10-13 ===
• Created Lesson00_HelloWorld project and confirmed successful build
• Committed verified environment to Git
• Added setup-complete tag for stable baseline
• Established Study & Learn Git Tagging Reference in Instructions
Status: Version control workflow fully operational
Next → Lesson 3: C# Classes & Objects

---
=== 2025-10-14 ===
• Built Character class with properties, constructor, and methods (Speak, Attack, Heal, ShowStatus)
• Practiced object creation, interaction, and encapsulation
• Learned how constructors remove null warnings
• Verified multi-object behavior and dynamic output
Status: Lesson 3 Part 1 complete — Classes & Objects fundamentals mastered
Next → Lesson 3 Part 2: Properties, Visibility, and Constructors (deeper dive)

──────────  ENTRY  ──────────
Date: 2025-10-18
Lesson(s) covered: C# Classes & Objects 3.2 — Properties & Constructors
Pre-Test quick summary: Strong grasp of properties; needed reminder that parameterless constructor is not auto-generated once a parameterized constructor exists.
Today’s key concept(s): Auto-properties vs full properties with backing fields; validation/clamping; accessors (get/set, private set); constructors with parameters; constructor chaining via this(...).
What clicked: Backing fields enabling validation rules; chaining the default constructor to centralize initialization.
What was fuzzy: Resolved — constructor defaults rule now clear after practice.
Where I want more practice: Designing property invariants and applying them to RPG entities (Characters/NPCs).
What I built / changed: Lesson03_PropertiesAndConstructors console app; Character class with clamped Health/Mana, methods (TakeDamage/Heal/ShowStatus); experimented with a third character and varied inputs.
Time spent: ~45 minutes
Mood / energy: Focused, confident.
Next step suggestion (AI): Proceed to Lesson 3.3 — Encapsulation patterns, static members (shared data), and a quick unit-test style check for invariants.
