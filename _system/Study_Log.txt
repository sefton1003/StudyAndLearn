Date: 2025-10-10
Lesson(s) covered: C# Basics – Variables & Types
Pre-Test quick summary: Confident with core terms; small syntax gaps.
Today’s key concept(s): Declaring and using variables; input/output; type conversion with Parse; string interpolation.
What clicked: Relationship between variable types and data.
What was fuzzy: Remembering exact punctuation and modifiers like $.
Where I want more practice: Syntax precision and efficient logic.
What I built / changed: Name-and-score console app with bonus calculation.
Time spent: ~40 minutes
Mood / energy: Focused and optimistic; “good kind of hard.”
Next step suggestion (AI): Proceed to Lesson 2 — Control Flow (if/else, loops).

──────────  ENTRY  ──────────
Date: 2025-10-11
Lesson(s) covered: C# Control Flow 2
Pre-Test quick summary: Knew basics of if/else and loops; unsure about when to use for vs while.
Today’s key concept(s): Conditional branching (if/else, logical operators) and iterative control (for, while, do...while).
What clicked: Loop syntax and modular (CodexBuzz) pattern logic; how to combine multiple conditions.
What was fuzzy: Deciding when to use for vs while; will explore more examples.
Where I want more practice: Nested conditionals and input validation.
What I built / changed: Even/Odd Countdown program and CodexBuzz stretch challenge.
Time spent: ~45 min
Mood / energy: Focused, confident.
Next step suggestion (AI): Begin Lesson 3 – C# Classes & Objects after reviewing the difference between for- and while-loops in small test snippets.
