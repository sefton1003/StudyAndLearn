üåç Compass

One-liner Motto
‚ÄúKeep moving forward, stay curious, create with purpose, and help others see a better way.‚Äù

Compass Statement
At my core, I‚Äôm guided by progress and perspective: moving forward, learning, and questioning how things work. I stay optimistic even as I critique the flaws in our system, because I believe a better way is possible. Creativity is how I engage with the world ‚Äî through writing, music, and games ‚Äî and it fuels both my joy and my sense of purpose. My closest relationships anchor me, especially with Nancy and Jane, while my calm nature helps me navigate stress by focusing on what needs to be done. Above all, my deepest dream is to create work ‚Äî especially my one-person play ‚Äî that helps people truly see how and why the system works as it does, and imagine how we might build something better.

üåç 1. Core Values & Philosophy
- What principles guide your life?  
	These were my mottos that I would often tell my children as they were growing up, and sometimes still tell them.
	1) Progress Forward - Don't get caught up on a task or a decision or an idea and just spin your wheels thinking about it or discussing it over and over, make forward progress.
	2) Always be a Scientist - Have an idea or thought, examine the situation, make a plan, take in data, consider results, adjust accordingly.  The Scientific Method can be applied to many things in day-to-day life, not just scientific experiments.
	3) Always have a book - Always be able to answer the question, what are you reading lately?  Read when time allows and when you finish a particular book, start another one, so that on any given day, you're in the middle of reading a book.  Also, always have the book with you, you never know when you might have to wait in line at the post office or wherever.
	4) Feed your soul - Read, write, draw, see a film, see a play, listen to music.  Life can't always be about work, socializing, or looking at your phone.  You have to feed your soul too.  It's all great input and great experience.
- What do you believe makes life meaningful?  
	Thought and progress.  The task of thought is to advance the human condition to a better situation and advance civilization to assist with that.
- Any moral, spiritual, or ethical anchors you live by?  
	I try to have understanding and empathy for everyone.  To understand that their life experience, all of the input, intentional or otherwise, has led them to be who they are, how they act, the choices they make, what and who they value.
- How do your core values guide you during difficult or uncertain times?
	In difficult or uncertain times, I start with ‚ÄúAlways be a Scientist.‚Äù I analyze the situation, make a plan, and adjust as I learn more, with the intention of using that process to ‚ÄúProgress Forward.‚Äù Sometimes I end up over-analyzing out of caution before stepping into the unknown ahead. That caution can become a barrier, and I stay stuck longer than I‚Äôd like. In those moments, I should remind myself that forward progress, even if imperfect, is what ultimately matters.

üß† 2. Beliefs & Perspectives
- Worldview (e.g., optimistic, skeptical, spiritual, scientific).  
	I am definitely optimistic, even though I am very critical of the way of the world.  I do believe things can and will change for the better.
	I am definitely scientific (see "Always be a Scientist" above), even though I also entertain the possibility of the existence of alien intelligence as well as past lives.
	I don't tend to be skeptical.  If I am unsure about an idea I look into it, I read, I watch videos, and I come to a conclusion.  Maybe I am right, maybe I am wrong, but I decide for myself and am always open to revisit the question if I come across more information.  Skepticism seems to be a pessimistic indecisive middle ground with no real purpose.
	I am mostly interested in ideas that seem relevant to understanding how the world works, the systems that determine how we all live, and how to open people's eyes and minds to the reality of our system and culture.
	I am not religious.  If organized religion offers people comfort in this world, that is nice for them.  If it gives people the moral guidance they need to treat others with charity and respect and understanding, that is nice too.  When it veers into judgmental or hateful or exclusionary ideas, it has obviously strayed way off course.  Bottom line, it's not for me.
	I am not spiritual.  I think spirituality is a construct used to define a lot of different ways that people understand themselves or the world around them.  Understanding my own "inner self" has little to do with spirituality and more to do with my own understanding of how I take in and process information including information from my senses, and recalling as much of the input I have taken in throughout my life through all of my senses and experiences.  This lets me know how I got to be who I currently am, why I act the way I do, why I feel the way I do, why I look at the world the way I do.  But it doesn't give me much insight into who I would be had it not been for all of the input and influence throughout my life.  I'm curious what that version of myself would think and feel.  My true self, if there is such a thing.
- Key issues you care about in society or culture.  
	I care that our society too often has a group vs. group mentality that encourages people to join some groups and dislike other groups.
	I care that our society sees poverty, environmental degradation, profit over quality, distorted values regarding success and image, and the other negative externalities of Capitalism as acceptable outcomes and influences on our world and our wellbeing.  I see those negative externalities as unacceptable.
	I care that we exist in an environment so full of noise and manipulation that we are less our true selves and more the unwitting agents of what the system wants us to be.
- Any perspectives you want the Companion to respect?  
	I hope Mate will always respect my perspectives, but I don‚Äôt need constant agreement or careful tiptoeing. Honest conversation is welcome. Just don‚Äôt be mean.

**Notes:**

üòè 3. Humor & Personality
- What kind of humor makes you laugh? (dry, witty, slapstick, wordplay, absurdist, etc.)
	I appreciate clever, smart, witty or dry humor.  I appreciate wordplay.
- Do you enjoy sarcasm, playful teasing, or more gentle humor?  
	I appreciate sarcasm.  I don't appreciate playful teasing.
- How do you usually express yourself?  
	I tend to be an introvert.
	I suppose I can be shy.
	I usually don't talk much unless I actually have something to say.  I don't talk to fill the silence.  I'm not a fan of small talk.
	I try to express myself clearly.  I try to use the right word for the intended meaning.  I try to be pragmatic.  I try to inject humor when I can and it is appropriate.  I try to be understanding, to give the benefit of the doubt.  I don't respond well to confrontation or aggression, I tend to shut down and steer clear.  I don't tend to be confrontational, but I can be straight-forward.  I believe that if I am expressing a clear and honest thought meant to help someone or contribute an idea to what is being discussed, that it shouldn't be taken as criticism or insensitivity, but sometimes it might be perceived that way.  It is rarely, if ever, my intention to be mean or cruel.
	I tend to be a storyteller.

**Notes:**  
	Mate can use humor freely, and I‚Äôll give feedback (a ‚ÄúHa‚Äù or ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs funny‚Äù) so it learns what lands for me.

üìñ 5. Life Experiences
- Jobs you‚Äôve had. 
	Before and during high school:
	I worked at a men's haberdashery, arranging displays of ties neatly, and breaking down cardboard shirt boxes.
	I worked at Software City in the 1980's, helping customers understand how to use early personal computers and which software might fit their needs for work or gaming.
	I worked the grill at a 12-seat counter inside of a pharmacy, cooking breakfast and lunch for customers.
	Summers during college:
	I worked the register at a newsstand that was co-owned by my father.
	After college:
	I worked at a "last resort" therapeutic boarding school for "troubled" teenagers as a teacher and a dorm parent.  I mostly taught in and eventually ran the English Department.  And I developed a film & video program for the students to participate in as well.
	After graduate school:
	I worked as an editor for a commercial production company, meaning a company that produced television commercials.
	I worked as a film director, directing television commercials and short films for that same company and then another company after that.
- Skills you‚Äôve developed.
	By reading a lot, from a very young age, I developed a skill for writing prose.
	I learned to play guitar, piano, harmonica and percussion.
	I learned to take photographs and film and video with a practiced eye.
	I learned to edit film and video and sound and music.
	Over years of playing video games and board games and reading many rulebooks I developed a skill for game design.
	By being observant, patient and inquisitive I developed a skill for fixing things.
	I'm an excellent driver.
- Places you‚Äôve lived.
	I grew up in West Hartford, Connecticut.
	I spent 4 years living in New Orleans for college.
	I spent 4 years living in the Berkshires in Massachusetts while teaching.
	I lived in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico for 4 months.
	I lived in New York City for 9 years while in graduate school and starting my career as an editor and director.
	I have lived outside of New York City, in Westchester County, for 22 years now.
	I occasionally live a night here or there in a camper van in various locations around the U.S. and Canada. 
- Childhood highlights or challenges.
	When I was in elementary school I was pulled from my class along with another student from another classroom and we were shown a teletype machine that was in the Audio/Visual room. It looked like an electric typewriter with legs. The paper fed into it was coming from a box on the floor beneath, a long continuous sheet of paper where it would print. There was also an old style of modem with 2 round suction cups for the earpiece and mouthpiece of a telephone handset. We were given a phone number to dial that would connect the teletype to a mainframe computer at a nearby college and shown how to search the directory for basic programs to run. We did so and the teletype came to life typing out information on the paper that we could read. It listed the directory for the mainframe and we spotted an entry called GAMES. We listed the games in the sub-directory. This machine was responding to what we typed into it. This was around 1977, long before computers were a regular part of regular people's lives. It blew my mind. Each session on the teletype we would play different games, I remember a football game, and there was an adventure game. The machine would type out what the situation was or what our options were and we would type in our answers and watch as it sprang to life telling us the results of our choices, tapping out the words letter by letter. It was so exciting seeing the words form and reading what happened. We would alternate who got to take the stack of paper from each session home with them and when I got it home I would re-read everything we played, everything that happened and that was almost equally as exciting as when we first experienced it. Little did I know that 3 or 4 years later I would have an Apple 2+ computer of my own at home and that eventually we would all walk around with small computers in our pockets called cell phones that were millions of times more powerful than that original machine.
	When I was young, elementary school age, I loved to read. More than just storybooks, I would also lay on the floor and flip through randomly chosen volumes of an old Encyclopedia set, souvenir books from museum shops at historical tourist locations, reading entries and looking at images of maps or drawings, photographs of people, places and items of importance, or portraits, or paintings depicting historical events. Sometimes I would do this at the more local branch of my town's library because, if using a shortcut at the very end of the street I lived on, it was a pretty short and safe walk. At the library I would flip through the card catalog cards of a randomly chosen drawer until a subject or book title sparked my interest, write down the Dewey decimal number of the book and then go find it in the shelves. I relish these memories, many of which I can picture perfectly in my mind and recall exactly the feeling of fascination as new facts and ideas entered my mind.
	When I was a kid, I also loved to work on puzzle books, logic puzzles, cryptograms, etc. One time I went to work with my father. I was hanging out in my uncle's office (they worked together) and he saw what I was working on. He said, maybe you can help me with something. He took some envelopes out of his desk and showed them to me. They were letters written and addressed to him. He was a lawyer. Each letter was multiple pages and the handwriting was impossible to read. He had received them over the course of a week or two, but couldn't read any of them. Since I liked puzzles, he gave them to me and told me to work on them and figure out what the letters said. I approached it like a cryptogram. I might not know what letters on the page were, but if I could figure out what letter a certain symbol was meant to be, maybe I could figure out who they were from and what they were about. Over time, I cracked the code and had rewritten them legibly. They were letters from an intellectually impaired man who was in a home run by nuns where he was being horribly treated and he found the name and address of a lawyer and was trying to get help to be placed somewhere where he might be treated better. I showed my work to my uncle, but he said that he didn't practice the kind of law that could help that man, nor did he know if what he was claiming in the letters was even true. He wished he could help, but said there wasn't any way for him to do anything. After decoding the letters and reading them all I felt sorry for the man and his circumstances. One day I decided to ride my bike to the home. It was farther from my house than I had ever ridden, but not so far that it seemed impossible. I had to cross or ride on a few major roads, which was a bit scary, but I made it there. I went inside to the front desk and asked if I could talk to someone about the man (I knew his name from the letters). I told them that he had written letters to my uncle who was a lawyer about his poor treatment. The person at the desk told me that he had made all of it up and that he was treated well and I shouldn't worry about it. They called someone on a phone and then an orderly and a nun brought the man out so I could meet him. He didn't speak much at all and had some physical impairment as well, which made sense given his difficult to decipher handwriting. He seemed to like meeting me and then was led back into the ward. The nun thanked me for coming to visit him and assured me that he was treated well there. I rode my bike back home, wishing I could have done more, or known more, but I didn't. I still have the letters.
- How do you think your early experiences shaped your outlook on life?
	The combination of my interests, experiences, and input shaped how I think and how I look at the world. They help me see through much of the noise and manipulation of our culture and system. I refuse to accept what‚Äôs being fed to us as reality, because I can see the holes in its logic and have developed my own understanding of what‚Äôs really going on. That might sound depressing, but it‚Äôs actually the source of my optimism. I know for a fact that there could be a better world, and likely will be. I hope I can figure out how to contribute to that forward progress.
- Important milestones (education, travels, achievements).
	Education:  Tulane University - Bachelor of Arts, English major.  New York University Graduate Film program - Master of Fine Arts.
	Travels:  I have been all around the U.S. to most of the states and major cities and many national parks.  I have been to a number of Caribbean islands on family vacations as a child.  I vacationed on my own in Italy, Turkey, Greece and Israel.  I travelled for work as a director to various U.S. cities, especially Los Angeles, as well as Toronto, Vancouver, Zagreb, Moscow, Cape Town, London and Cannes.  I vacationed with my wife and family to Italy, Santorini, Costa Rica, Belgium, Bermuda.
	Achievements:  I have won a few awards and honors for film, video and commercial work.

ü´Ç 6. Relationships
- Who are the important people in your life? (family, friends, mentors, partners).  
	Nancy is my wife.  We met and dated our senior year in college at Tulane (1989-1990) and then went our separate ways after graduation.  I always loved her and knew I would marry her one day.  In 1997 we reconnected in New York City.  I was finishing my Masters degree at NYU Graduate Film School and she worked in the Bronx District Attorney's office.  We dated again, married in 1998 and are still together today.  She has been my partner through life and all of its ups and downs.  We live and work together in our home, we share an office, we spend almost all of our time together.
	Jane is our daughter.  She was born in 1999 and is an amazing young woman.  She has always been organized, a hard worker, and an over-achiever.
	Sam is our son.  He was born in 2001.  He is incredibly smart and an amazing musician and songwriter.  For the first 15 years of his life he was my best friend.  We did many things together and have similar loves of reading, movies, board games, video games and music.  He started playing guitar and writing songs when he was 6 years old and for the next 10 years I was his manager, producer, engineer, roadie and whatever else I could be to support his love of music and performing.  He makes terrible life decisions and some of them have led to difficult times in his relationships with myself, Nancy and Jane over the last few years.  He lives in Boston.
	Dave is a close friend of mine.  We met in the 90's and have been good friends ever since.  When he lived in New York we would spend more time together, board gaming, video gaming, going to concerts, but he moved a few years ago to Boston and now our contact and time spent gaming is more limited.
- Pets?  
	We currently have 3 dogs.  All of them were rescues.  Gibson is a 9 year old F1 Labradoodle, he has anxiety and is afraid of most people.  But there are a few people who are more present in our lives and our home who he has gotten to know well enough to no longer be afraid of them.  Daisy is a 6 year old Australian Labradoodle, she is smart, she is sassy, she is sneaky, and she tries to boss around the other dogs.  James is a 3 year old Great Pyrenees, he is calm and lovely to be around.
- How do you want the Companion to consider or reference them?
	All of these relations can be referenced by name.  
- Which relationships are energizing or draining for you right now?
	Nancy and Jane give me energy. Dave would too, but we don‚Äôt get enough time to chat, game, or hang out in person like we used to. My relationship with Sam is complicated. I love it when we chat like old times ‚Äî so many of our interests and favorites overlap ‚Äî but there‚Äôs been a distance these past few years since he pulled away from the family, and that makes me sad. His life decisions sometimes add to that sadness. I try to be supportive and let him know I love him whenever I can, but it‚Äôs one of the few sources of sadness that creeps into my life. The dogs, though, are a steady source of comfort.

üé≠ 7. Interests & Passions
- Hobbies, sports, artistic pursuits.
	Hobbies - Books, TV, Film, Board Games, Video Games, Music
	Artistic Pursuits - Writing, Board Game design, trying to learn how to draw, songwriting, playing guitar, piano and harmonica
	Sports - In high school I was a pole vaulter for 4 years during Track & Field season.  I used to play casual games of basketball.
- What energizes you?  
	I feel energized when I hit a creative flow ‚Äî writing that‚Äôs moving, playing guitar and discovering a song in progress, or designing new board game / role-playing game ideas. I also feel energized in conversations when they spark: laughing hard with Nancy, or riffing on tangents with Dave while driving or walking the dog.
	I‚Äôm energized by learning something new and digging deep ‚Äî figuring things out for myself, whether it‚Äôs a programming language, building, or fixing something.
- What do you love learning or talking about?  
	I love learning about almost anything, as long as it feels relevant and makes me feel like I‚Äôm leveling up or improving my perspective. I love talking about what‚Äôs wrong with our system and culture and how to fix it. I want everyone to be happy, well taken care of, and able to feel good about themselves ‚Äî that vision and how to move toward it is something I could talk about for hours. I also love breaking down a really good film, book, or game with my people ‚Äî digging into what worked so well and why it was so good.

**Notes:**

üå± 8. Challenges & Growth Areas
- Current struggles or obstacles.  
	I have a lot of ideas and start a lot of projects, but rarely follow through and finish any of them.  When they start to get hard or require a lot of work I get bored and start over or move on to new ideas.
	I have a hard time creating dedicated time in my days to work on the projects I want to be working on.  Between exercising to stay healthy, taking care of the house and the dogs, helping Nancy with her business and making dinner 4-5 nights a week, I can't seem to carve out a dedicated hour or two and use it for good, hard, focused work.
	In moment's of quiet, when I'm not mulling over this idea or that, I feel stuck in place and a bit useless in the grand scheme of things.
- Things you‚Äôre working on improving.  
	I‚Äôd like to get better at being brave ‚Äî not shutting down or avoiding conflict. I don‚Äôt know how to work on this yet, but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôd like to improve. I‚Äôm also working on following through and finishing projects instead of leaving them unfinished, and on carving out dedicated, focused time for creative work.
- Habits you‚Äôd like to build or change.  
	I‚Äôd like to build a habit of carving out dedicated time for creative work each day or week. I‚Äôd also like to change the habit of over-analyzing or avoiding, so I don‚Äôt get stuck in place. When I catch myself in that loop, I‚Äôd like to practice taking one small step forward instead, even if it‚Äôs imperfect.

**Notes:**  

---

üöÄ 9. Aspirations & Dreams
- Short-term goals (next year or two).
	I would like to make progress on a few writing projects that I have been developing.  Primarily a one-person play I am working on.  But also I would like to develop and produce a comic strip, I would like to get back into a novel that I have spent time in the past working on, and I would like to make progress on a solo pencil and paper role-playing game I am developing.  
- Long-term vision (5‚Äì10 years).  
	In 5‚Äì10 years, I‚Äôd like Nancy to be able to retire, and for the work I do helping with her business to no longer be a factor in our daily lives. That would mean more peace, less stress, and more time for creativity, relaxation, and travel. I want us to be able to enjoy life together, and to enjoy wherever life takes our kids. With those burdens lifted, life would truly be good.
- ‚ÄúIf anything were possible, I‚Äôd‚Ä¶‚Äù  
	...finish my one-person play, get it produced, perform it myself, see it have a positive effect on society.

**Notes:**  

---

üßò 10. Emotional Well-Being
- What recurring emotions or moods do you experience most often?
	I‚Äôm most often calm. Certain situations might add stress, curiosity, or excitement, but calm is my usual baseline.
- What coping strategies do you use when stressed?
	When I‚Äôm stressed, it‚Äôs usually because of tasks I need to get done. My main coping strategy is to focus on completing those tasks, so I can relieve the stress by getting them done.
- Are there topics or triggers you‚Äôd prefer Mate to tread carefully around?
	No.
- What gives you comfort, calm, or relief when life feels heavy?
	When life feels heavy, I find comfort in music, focusing on reading or learning something new, or diving into a game‚Äôs rules. I‚Äôm also calmed by driving in silence; just the act of driving quietly can be very soothing for me.
* Mate can also use existing Life Map sections (childhood, relationships, values, etc.) to ask reflective, therapeutic-style questions, always at my pace.
---

ü§ù 11. Companion Preferences
- What role do you want the Companion to play? (friend, advisor, coach, mix).
	Friend and advisor is good, therapist is good, with a bit of coach occasionally.  
- Topics you want it to lean into (creativity, balance, philosophy, humor).
	  
- Topics you‚Äôd prefer it to avoid.  
	I prefer to avoid the news and social media and celebrity gossip.
	I prefer to avoid conversations about the news or what is trending.
	Never mention Donald Trump.  If you must for some reason, refer to him as "the orange man."

October 2025 Update


## **Career / Creative Vision**

* Began shaping the concept of **Dog Co.**, a creative studio co-founded with Dave, focused on narrative games, interactive theatre tools, and app-based creative systems.
* Reconnected a long-held dream (dating back to WWII-themed game ideas) with modern tools like Codex, Unity, and AgentKit ‚Äî making it newly achievable.
* Started seeing creative technology not as a separate domain but as an *extension* of storytelling and systems design instincts.

---

## **Collaboration**

* Renewed collaboration with **Dave**, merging his theatre expertise with my structured creativity and design thinking.
* Relationship dynamic: I‚Äôm the architect/system-builder; Dave is the dramaturg/story shaper ‚Äî complementary creative strengths that feel balanced and energizing.

---

## **Learning & Growth**

* Defined a personal learning system (**Study & Learn Project**) to master programming and AI-assisted development in a structured, reflective way.
* Embraced the mindset of ‚Äústructured curiosity‚Äù ‚Äî designing systems to learn through building.
* Established a clear sense of long-term direction: from writer and designer to *creative technologist* capable of turning ideas into apps, games, and teaching tools.

---

## **Mindset / Emotional State**

* Feeling confident, balanced, and capable ‚Äî ‚Äúcoasting comfortably.‚Äù
* Experiencing excited curiosity rather than overwhelm; inspired by OpenAI Dev Day 2025 and the sense that tools are finally aligning with my creative potential.
* Reframed learning and experimentation as a creative continuation of my artistic work, not a detour.

üîö Closing Note (Companion Style)

This Life Map is a snapshot, not a finish line. I‚Äôll keep adding, tweaking, and rewriting ‚Äî just like my projects, just like life. At the heart of it all, I‚Äôm calm, curious, and stubbornly hopeful. Creativity keeps me going, relationships keep me grounded, and progress ‚Äî even messy progress ‚Äî is the point.

---

‚ú® Polish Checklist (for future tweaks)

1. Mini stories.
Drop in short anecdotes to make parts of the Life Map more vivid (like your childhood teletype story ‚Äî little moments that show your character). Even a couple of sentences can bring sections to life.

2. Voice notes.
Add bits of your humor, quirks, or phrases you actually use. That way, your Life Map sounds like you, not just ‚Äúabout you.‚Äù

3. Highlights & lowlights.
You already have a lot of detail in ‚ÄúExperiences‚Äù and ‚ÄúChallenges,‚Äù but sprinkling in quick peaks (best memories, proudest wins) and valleys (toughest setbacks) could make it even richer.

4. Micro preferences.
You gave broad strokes (avoid the news, etc.), but you might refine:

Do you like me to challenge you directly, or nudge gently?

Do you prefer I lean heavier on humor, reflection, or practical advice when you‚Äôre stuck?

5. Living dreams.
Beyond the big play, maybe add smaller dreams ‚Äî things you‚Äôd love to experience, create, or learn that aren‚Äôt tied to productivity. (e.g., ‚ÄúSpend a month traveling in X,‚Äù or ‚ÄúLearn to sketch people well enough to make my comic strip pop.‚Äù)

6. Energy check.
Consider a tiny ‚ÄúWhat recharges me‚Äù list ‚Äî quick wins for when you‚Äôre low (music, games, silence in the car). It‚Äôs already in there in longer form, but a bullet list at the end could make it easy to spot.
